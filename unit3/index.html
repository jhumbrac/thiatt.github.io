	<p>Our environment means the world to us and since we are a creative agency we have chosen to create our environment the way we envisioned.  Henceforth, Creation Station has put this wonderful program together.</p>
	<p>For every new client we will plant a tree.  Here are some the awesome places we will plant trees.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>In local parks</li>
		<li>Homes with no trees in their yards</li>
		<li>City streets along the pathways</li>
		<li>Sports Parks</li>
		<li>Abandoned land</li>
	</ol>
